# Images Directory

## How to add your SowSure screenshot:

1. **Take a screenshot** of your SowSure project (preferably 1200x800 or 1920x1080 for best quality)

2. **Save the image** as one of these formats:
   - `sowsure-screenshot.jpg` (recommended)
   - `sowsure-screenshot.png` 
   - `sowsure-demo.jpg`
   - `sowsure-demo.png`

3. **Copy the file** to this directory: 
   `C:\Users\HP\Documents\personal-website\public\images\`

4. **Update the filename** in the Portfolio component if needed:
   - Currently set to: `/images/sowsure-screenshot.jpg`
   - Change in: `components/Portfolio.tsx` line ~67

## Image Requirements:
- **Resolution**: 1200x800px minimum (1920x1080 recommended)
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **File size**: Under 2MB for faster loading
- **Content**: Show the main dashboard or key features of SowSure

## Alternative: Use an online image
If you prefer to host the image online, you can use:
- GitHub repository images
- Imgur links
- Cloudinary
- Any public image hosting service

Just replace the `image:` path in Portfolio.tsx with the full URL.
